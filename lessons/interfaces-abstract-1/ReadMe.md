## Interfaces
![ puzzle pieces ]( https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Android/blob/master/lessons/interfaces-abstract-part2/img/puzzle_pieces.gif )

<br />
There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for several groups of programmers working on a large scale application to agree to a "contract" that spells out how their software interacts. **Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other group's code is written.** Generally speaking, interfaces in Java act as the contracts for your code. 

In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.

Interfaces cannot be instantiated—they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
Quick example:
``` java
public interface OperateCar {
   
   int signalTurn(Direction direction, boolean signalOn);
   // more method signatures
}
```



### Defining an Interface
An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword `interface`, the interface name, a comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the interface body. For example:
```java
public interface ExampleInterface extends InterfaceOne, InterfaceTwo {

    // base of natural logarithms
    double E = 2.718282;

    // method signatures
    void doSomething (int i, double x);
    
    int doSomethingElse(String s);
}
```
The public access specifier indicates that the interface can be used by any class in any package. If you do not specify that the interface is public, then your interface is accessible only to classes defined in the same package as the interface. *We'll explain thi more as a group.*

An interface can extend other interfaces, just as a class subclass or extend another class. However, whereas a class can extend only one other class, an interface can extend any number of interfaces. The interface declaration includes a comma-separated list of all the interfaces that it extends.

The interface body can contain abstract methods, default methods, and static methods. An abstract method within an interface is followed by a semicolon, but no braces (an abstract method does not contain an implementation). Default methods are defined with the default modifier, and static methods with the static keyword. All abstract, default, and static methods in an interface are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier.

In addition, an interface can contain constant declarations. All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final. Once again, you can omit these modifiers.

### Implementing an interfaces
To declare a class that implements an interface, you include an implements clause in the class declaration. Your class can implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of the interfaces implemented by the class. By convention, the implements clause follows the extends clause, if there is one.

Consider an interface that defines how to compare the size of objects.
```java
public interface Relatable {

    // this (object calling isLargerThan)
    // and other must be instances of
    // the same class returns 1, 0, -1
    // if this is greater than,
    // equal to, or less than other
    public int isLargerThan(Relatable other);
}
```
If you want to be able to COMPARE the size of SIMILIAR objects, no matter what they are, the class that instantiates them should implement Relatable.

Any class can implement Relatable if there is some way to compare the relative "size" of objects instantiated from the class. For strings, it could be number of characters; for books, it could be number of pages; for students, it could be weight; and so forth. For planar geometric objects, area would be a good choice (see the RectanglePlus class that follows), while volume would work for three-dimensional geometric objects. All such classes can implement the isLargerThan() method.

If you know that a class implements Relatable, then you know that you can compare the size of the objects instantiated from that class.

Implementing the Relatable Interface

Here is the Rectangle class written to implement Relatable.

```java
public class Rectangle implements Relatable {
    public int width = 0;
    public int height = 0;
    public Point origin;

    // four constructors
    public Rectangle() {
        origin = new Point(0, 0);
    }
    public Rectangle(Point p) {
        origin = p;
    }
    public Rectangle(int w, int h) {
        origin = new Point(0, 0);
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
    public Rectangle(Point p, int w, int h) {
        origin = p;
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    // a method for moving the rectangle
    public void move(int x, int y) {
        origin.x = x;
        origin.y = y;
    }

    // a method for computing
    // the area of the rectangle
    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }

    // a method required to implement
    // the Relatable interface
    public int isLargerThan(Relatable other) {
        Rectangle otherRect  = (Rectangle)other;
        if (this.getArea() < otherRect.getArea()){
            return -1;
        } else if (this.getArea() > otherRect.getArea()){
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```
Because Rectangle implements Relatable, the size of any two Rectangle objects can be compared.

Note: The isLargerThan method, as defined in the Relatable interface, takes an object of type Relatable.

The line of code, shown in bold in the previous example, casts `other` to a Rectangle instance.

**Type casting tells the compiler what the object really is.**

Invoking getArea directly on the `other` instance `(other.getArea())` would fail to compile because the compiler does not understand that `other` is actually an instance of Rectangle.

### Using an Interface as a Type

When you define a new interface, you are defining a new reference data type. You can use interface names anywhere you can use any other data type name. If you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface.

As an example, here is a method for finding the largest object in a pair of objects, for any objects that are instantiated from a class that implements Relatable:

```java
public Object findLargest(Object object1, Object object2) {
   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;
   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;
   if ((obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) > 0)
      return object1;
   else
      return object2;
}
```
By casting object1 to a Relatable type, it can invoke the isLargerThan method.

If you make a point of implementing Relatable in a wide variety of classes, the objects instantiated from any of those classes can be compared with the findLargest() method—provided that both objects are of the same class. Similarly, they can all be compared with the following methods:

```java
public Object findSmallest(Object object1, Object object2) {
   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;
   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;
   if ((obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) < 0)
      return object1;
   else
      return object2;
}

public boolean isEqual(Object object1, Object object2) {
   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;
   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;
   if ( (obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) == 0)
      return true;
   else
      return false;
}
```
These methods work for any "relatable" objects, no matter what their class inheritance is. When they implement Relatable, they can be of both their own class (or superclass) type and a Relatable type. This gives them some of the advantages of multiple inheritance, where they can have behavior from both a superclass and an interface.

### Evolving Interfaces

Consider an interface that you have developed called DoIt:

```java
public interface DoIt {

   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
}
```
Suppose that, at a later time, you want to add a third method to DoIt, so that the interface now becomes:

```java
public interface DoIt {

   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
   
   boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s);
}
```
**- If you make this change, then all classes that implement the old DoIt interface will break because they no longer implement the old interface.** Programmers relying on this interface will not be happy about this.

When writing Object Oriented Java try to build a mental model of your program and try to anticipate all uses for your interfaces before writing your code. If you want to add additional methods to an interface, you have several options. For example You could create a DoItPlus interface that extends DoIt:

```java
public interface DoItPlus extends DoIt {

   boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s);

}
```
Now users of your code can choose to continue to use the old interface or to upgrade to the new interface.

Alternatively, you can define your new methods as default methods. The following example defines a default method named didItWork:

```java
public interface DoIt {

   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
   default boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s) {
       // Method body
   }

}
```
Note that you must provide an implementation for default methods. You could also define new static methods to existing interfaces. Users who have classes that implement interfaces enhanced with new default or static methods do not have to modify or recompile them to accommodate the additional methods.

### Default Methods and their use case

Consider the use case of manufacturers of computer-controlled cars who publish industry-standard interfaces that describe which methods can be invoked to operate their cars. What if those computer-controlled car manufacturers add new functionality, such as flight, to their cars? These manufacturers would need to specify new methods to enable other companies (such as electronic guidance instrument manufacturers) to adapt their software to flying cars. Where would these car manufacturers declare these new flight-related methods? If they add them to their original interfaces, then programmers who have implemented those interfaces would have to rewrite their implementations. If they add them as static methods, then programmers would regard them as utility methods, not as essential, core methods.

> Default methods enable you to add new functionality to the interfaces of your libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.

Consider the following interface, TimeClient:

```java
import java.time.*;

public interface TimeClient {
    void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
    void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
    void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
                               int hour, int minute, int second);
    LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();
}
```

The following class, SimpleTimeClient, implements TimeClient:

```java
package defaultmethods;

import java.time.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

public class SimpleTimeClient implements TimeClient {

    private LocalDateTime dateAndTime;

    public SimpleTimeClient() {
        dateAndTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.from(dateAndTime);
        LocalTime timeToSet = LocalTime.of(hour, minute, second);
        dateAndTime = LocalDateTime.of(currentDate, timeToSet);
    }

    public void setDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        LocalDate dateToSet = LocalDate.of(day, month, year);
        LocalTime currentTime = LocalTime.from(dateAndTime);
        dateAndTime = LocalDateTime.of(dateToSet, currentTime);
    }

    public void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
                               int hour, int minute, int second) {
        LocalDate dateToSet = LocalDate.of(day, month, year);
        LocalTime timeToSet = LocalTime.of(hour, minute, second);
        dateAndTime = LocalDateTime.of(dateToSet, timeToSet);
    }

    public LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime() {
        return dateAndTime;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return dateAndTime.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        TimeClient myTimeClient = new SimpleTimeClient();
        System.out.println(myTimeClient.toString());
    }
}
```

Suppose that you want to add new functionality to the `TimeClient` interface, such as the ability to specify a time zone through a `ZonedDateTime` object (which is like a `LocalDateTime` object except that it stores time zone information):

```java
public interface TimeClient {
    void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
    void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
    void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
        int hour, int minute, int second);
    LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();
    ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString);
}
```

Following this modification to the `TimeClient` interface, you would also have to modify the class `SimpleTimeClient` and implement the method `getZonedDateTime`. However, rather than leaving `getZonedDateTime` as abstract (as in the previous example), you can instead define a default implementation. (Remember that an abstract method is a method declared without an implementation.)

```java
package defaultmethods;

import java.time.*;

public interface TimeClient {
    void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
    void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
    void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
                               int hour, int minute, int second);
    LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();

    static ZoneId getZoneId (String zoneString) {
        try {
            return ZoneId.of(zoneString);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            System.err.println("Invalid time zone: " + zoneString +
                "; using default time zone instead.");
            return ZoneId.systemDefault();
        }
    }

    default ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString) {
        return ZonedDateTime.of(getLocalDateTime(), getZoneId(zoneString));
    }
}
```

You specify that a method definition in an interface is a default method with the default keyword at the beginning of the method signature. All method declarations in an interface, including default methods, are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier.

With this interface, you do not have to modify the class `SimpleTimeClient`, and this class (and any class that implements the interface `TimeClient`), will have the method `getZonedDateTime` already defined. The following example, `TestSimpleTimeClient`, invokes the method `getZonedDateTime` from an instance of `SimpleTimeClient`:

```java
package defaultmethods;

import java.time.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TestSimpleTimeClient {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        TimeClient myTimeClient = new SimpleTimeClient();
        System.out.println("Current time: " + myTimeClient.toString());
        System.out.println("Time in California: " +
            myTimeClient.getZonedDateTime("Blah blah").toString());
    }
}
```

### Extending Interfaces That Contain Default Methods

When you extend an interface that contains a default method, you can do the following:

- Not mention the default method at all, which lets your extended interface inherit the default method.
- Redeclare the default method, which makes it abstract.
- Redefine the default method, which overrides it.

Suppose that you extend the interface `TimeClient` as follows:

```java
public interface AnotherTimeClient extends TimeClient { }
```

Any class that implements the interface `AnotherTimeClient` will have the implementation specified by the default method `TimeClient.getZonedDateTime`.

Suppose that you extend the interface `TimeClient` as follows:

```java
public interface AbstractZoneTimeClient extends TimeClient {
    public ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString);
}
```
Any class that implements the interface `AbstractZoneTimeClient` will have to implement the method `getZonedDateTime`; this method is an abstract method like all other nondefault (and nonstatic) methods in an interface.

Suppose that you extend the interface `TimeClient` as follows:

```java
public interface HandleInvalidTimeZoneClient extends TimeClient {
    default public ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString) {
        try {
            return ZonedDateTime.of(getLocalDateTime(),ZoneId.of(zoneString));
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            System.err.println("Invalid zone ID: " + zoneString +
                "; using the default time zone instead.");
            return ZonedDateTime.of(getLocalDateTime(),ZoneId.systemDefault());
        }
    }
}
```
Any class that implements the interface `HandleInvalidTimeZoneClient` will use the implementation of `getZonedDateTime` specified by this interface instead of the one specified by the interface TimeClient.

## The equals() Method

The equals() method compares two objects for equality and returns true if they are equal. The equals() method provided in the Object class uses the identity operator (==) to determine whether two objects are equal. For primitive data types, this gives the correct result. For objects, however, it does not. The equals() method provided by Object tests whether the object references are equal—that is, if the objects compared are the exact same object.

To test whether two objects are equal in the sense of equivalency (containing the same information), you must override the equals() method. Here is an example of a Book class that overrides equals():

```java
public class Book {
    ...
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof Book)
            return ISBN.equals((Book)obj.getISBN());
        else
            return false;
    }
}
```
Consider this code that tests two instances of the Book class for equality:
```java
// Swing Tutorial, 2nd edition
Book firstBook  = new Book("0201914670");
Book secondBook = new Book("0201914670");
if (firstBook.equals(secondBook)) {
    System.out.println("objects are equal");
} else {
    System.out.println("objects are not equal");
}
```
This program displays objects are equal even though firstBook and secondBook reference two distinct objects. They are considered equal because the objects compared contain the same ISBN number.

You should always override the equals() method if the identity operator is not appropriate for your class.

Note: If you override equals(), you must override hashCode() as well.


## The hashCode() Method

The value returned by hashCode() is the object's hash code, which is the object's memory address in hexadecimal.

By definition, if two objects are equal, their hash code must also be equal. If you override the equals() method, you change the way two objects are equated and Object's implementation of hashCode() is no longer valid. Therefore, if you override the equals() method, you must also override the hashCode() method as well.

## The getClass() Method

You cannot override getClass.

The getClass() method returns a Class object, which has methods you can use to get information about the class, such as its name (getSimpleName()), its superclass (getSuperclass()), and the interfaces it implements (getInterfaces()). For example, the following method gets and displays the class name of an object:

```java
void printClassName(Object obj) {
    System.out.println("The object's" + " class is " +
        obj.getClass().getSimpleName());
}
```

The Class class, in the java.lang package, has a large number of methods (more than 50). For example, you can test to see if the class is an annotation (isAnnotation()), an interface (isInterface()), or an enumeration (isEnum()). You can see what the object's fields are (getFields()) or what its methods are (getMethods()), and so on.


### Writing Final Classes and Methods

You can declare some or all of a class's methods final. You use the final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. The Object class does this—a number of its methods are final.

You might wish to make a method final if it has an implementation that should not be changed and it is critical to the consistent state of the object. For example, you might want to make the getFirstPlayer method in this ChessAlgorithm class final:
```java
class ChessAlgorithm {
    ...
    final ChessPlayer getFirstPlayer() {
        return ChessPlayer.WHITE;
    }
    ...
}
```
Methods called from constructors should generally be declared final. If a constructor calls a non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results.

Note that you can also declare an entire class final. A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String class.


## Polymorphism

The dictionary definition of polymorphism refers to a principle in biology in which an organism or species can have many different forms or stages. This principle can also be applied to object-oriented programming and languages like the Java language. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.

Polymorphism can be demonstrated with a minor modification to the Bicycle class. For example, a printDescription method could be added to the class that displays all the data currently stored in an instance.
```java
public void printDescription(){
    System.out.println("\nBike is " + "in gear " + this.gear
        + " with a cadence of " + this.cadence +
        " and travelling at a speed of " + this.speed + ". ");
}
```
To demonstrate polymorphic features in the Java language, extend the Bicycle class with a MountainBike and a RoadBike class. For MountainBike, add a field for suspension, which is a String value that indicates if the bike has a front shock absorber, Front. Or, the bike has a front and back shock absorber, Dual.

Here is the updated class:
```java
public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
    private String suspension;

    public MountainBike(
               int startCadence,
               int startSpeed,
               int startGear,
               String suspensionType){
        super(startCadence,
              startSpeed,
              startGear);
        this.setSuspension(suspensionType);
    }

    public String getSuspension(){
      return this.suspension;
    }

    public void setSuspension(String suspensionType) {
        this.suspension = suspensionType;
    }

    public void printDescription() {
        super.printDescription();
        System.out.println("The " + "MountainBike has a" +
            getSuspension() + " suspension.");
    }
}
```
Note the overridden printDescription method. In addition to the information provided before, additional data about the suspension is included to the output.

Next, create the RoadBike class. Because road or racing bikes have skinny tires, add an attribute to track the tire width. Here is the RoadBike class:
```java
public class RoadBike extends Bicycle{
    // In millimeters (mm)
    private int tireWidth;

    public RoadBike(int startCadence,
                    int startSpeed,
                    int startGear,
                    int newTireWidth){
        super(startCadence,
              startSpeed,
              startGear);
        this.setTireWidth(newTireWidth);
    }

    public int getTireWidth(){
      return this.tireWidth;
    }

    public void setTireWidth(int newTireWidth){
        this.tireWidth = newTireWidth;
    }

    public void printDescription(){
        super.printDescription();
        System.out.println("The RoadBike" + " has " + getTireWidth() +
            " MM tires.");
    }
}
```
Note that once again, the printDescription method has been overridden. This time, information about the tire width is displayed.

To summarize, there are three classes: Bicycle, MountainBike, and RoadBike. The two subclasses override the printDescription method and print unique information.

Here is a test program that creates three Bicycle variables. Each variable is assigned to one of the three bicycle classes. Each variable is then printed.
```java
public class TestBikes {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Bicycle bike01, bike02, bike03;

    bike01 = new Bicycle(20, 10, 1);
    bike02 = new MountainBike(20, 10, 5, "Dual");
    bike03 = new RoadBike(40, 20, 8, 23);

    bike01.printDescription();
    bike02.printDescription();
    bike03.printDescription();
  }
}
```
The following is the output from the test program:
```java
Bike is in gear 1 with a cadence of 20 and travelling at a speed of 10.

Bike is in gear 5 with a cadence of 20 and travelling at a speed of 10.
The MountainBike has a Dual suspension.

Bike is in gear 8 with a cadence of 40 and travelling at a speed of 20.
The RoadBike has 23 MM tires.
```
The Java virtual machine (JVM) calls the appropriate method for the object that is referred to in each variable. It does not call the method that is defined by the variable's type. This behavior is referred to as virtual method invocation and demonstrates an aspect of the important polymorphism features in the Java language.
