## Wrapper classes 

A **wrapper class** wraps (encloses) around a data type and gives it an object appearance. Wherever the data type is required as an object, this object can be instead. Wrapper classes include methods to unwrap the object and give back the original data type. 

Instead of:

```java
Integer i = new Integer(9);
```

use this:

```java
Integer i = 9;
```

A primitive-wrapper class in the Java language is one of eight classes provided in the `java.lang package` to provide object methods for the eight primitive types. All of the primitive wrapper classes in Java are immutable. J2SE 5.0 introduced **auto-boxing** of primitive types into their wrapper object, and automatic **unboxing** of the wrapper objects into their primitive value â€” the implicit conversion between the wrapper objects and primitive values.


| Primitive type  | Wrapper Class | Constructor Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `byte` | `Byte` | `byte` or `String` |
| `short` | `Short` | `short` or `String`	 |
| `int` | `Integer` | `int` or `String` |
| `long` | `Long` | `long` or `String` |
| `float` | `Float` | `float`, `double` or `String` |
| `double` | `Double` | `double` or `String` |
| `char` | `Character` | `char` |
| `boolean` | `Boolean` | `boolean` or `String` |


## Auto-boxing and unboxing

**Auto-boxing** is the term for getting a reference type out of a value type just through type conversion (either implicit or explicit). The compiler automatically supplies the extra source code which creates the object.

If we move in the opposite direction, then it's called **unboxing**.

![Autoboxing/unboxing](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/AutoBoxing_UnBoxing.png)

##### Here are a couple of examples:

- Value passed to a variable

```java
// Autoboxing an int value to an Integer object wrapper type
Integer number1 = 25;

// Unboxing an int value from an Integer object into an int value
int number2 = number1;

System.out.println(number1);
System.out.println(number2);
```

#### Why should you care? 

- Auto-boxing/unboxing is heavily used in Java Collections:

- Value passed as a parameter

```java
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();

numbers.add(5); // Although the add method asks for a parameter of type Integer, we can use 
                // the primitive 5 because it gets automatically auto-boxed into 
                // an object of type Integer implicitly.

numbers.add(6);

System.out.println(numbers.get(0)); // prints 5

System.out.println(numbers.get(1)); // prints 6
```

More on this later!

## Static methods

A **static method** is a method that belongs to a class, not an instance of the class.

You can call a static method directly on the class, for example:

```java
String.format("Formatting the number %d", 9);
```

#### A useful static method of the Integer class:

```java
static int parseInt(String s) 
```

This method parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer.

The following will generate a compiler error:

```java
String stringNumber = "1000"; 
int value = stringNumber;
System.out.println(value);
```

Output:
```java
java: incompatible types
required: int
found: java.lang.String
```

#### Instead use:

```java
// Outputs 1000
String stringNumber = "1000";     
int value = Integer.parseInt(stringNumber);
System.out.println(value);
```

## Exception handling

An **exception** is an event occurring during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. You may have already encountered some Java exceptions while building and debugging your programs, like `NullPointerException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The following block generates a `NumberFormatException`:

```java
String stringNumber = "1000cats";
int value = Integer.parseInt(stringNumber);
System.out.println(value);
```

Valid Java must honor the **Catch or Specify Requirement**. This means code might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:

* A `try` statement that catches the exception.
* A method that specifies that it can `throw` the exception.

Code that does not honor the Catch or Specify Requirement will not compile.

```java
// Try statement catches the exception
// Output: Not a proper integer value!
try {
    String stringNumber = "1000cats";
    int value = Integer.parseInt(stringNumber);
    System.out.println(value);
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    System.out.println("Not a proper integer value!");
}
```

```java
// Method specifies that it can throw the exception
public void parseToInteger() throws NumberFormatException {
    String stringNumber = "1000cats";
    int value = Integer.parseInt(stringNumber);
    System.out.println(value);
}
```

**Note:** You should only use try/catch blocks to handle exceptions - not control the flow of execution of your program. If you want to change the direction on your program you should instead you logic to to do this - i.e. if/else statements, switch statements, loops, etc.

## File I/O

Last week, you learned how to accept user input with a Scanner object. A scanner can also be useful for reading input from a text file because it can break down formatted text into tokens. By default, a scanner uses white space (e.g. spaces, tabs, and `\n` line terminators) to separate tokens.

The following program uses a scanner to read the individual words in `my_text_file.txt` and print each one out on a new line.

```java
public class ScanFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        Scanner scanner = null;

        try {
            scanner = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("my_text_file.txt")));
            while (scanner.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(scanner.next());
            }
        } finally {
            if (scanner != null) {
                scanner.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
