### Problem Sets (Must Submit For Review)

Please complete all three of the problems in an IntelliJ project. Each solution should be in its own class with the main method in the Main class invoking the three solution methods from each object instance. Please send me (Bobby) the github link to your repo when complete.

### Q1. Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Note that an empty string is also considered valid.:

```java
//Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: true

//Example 2: 
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

//Example 3
Input: "(]"
Output: false
```

```java
public class ParBalance {

    public boolean checkBalance(String s){

    }

}
```

### Q2. Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

```java 
//Example 
//Given nums = [1,1,2],

//Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

//It does nott matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

public class UniqueArray{
    
    public int uniqueArr(int[] nums){

    }
}
```

### Q3. This method takes a string, then returns the longest series of unique letters in that string.

```java 
//Example 
//Input: "abcabcbb"
//Output: 3 
//Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

public class MySequence {

    public int getSequence(String s){

    }
}
```java
